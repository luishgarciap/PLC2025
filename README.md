# Code for Programming Language Concepts modules at Aston University

I recommend to use the code via 

* Aston Ubuntu VDI

or in an online IDE, such as:

* [repl.it](https://repl.it) (nice, but does not support Ada and Lisp)
    * first time, make a [new clone of this repo](https://repl.it/github/vejdanpa/PLC2023)

* [rextester](https://rextester.com/l/common_lisp_online_compiler)  (supports all our PLs)
